bud1ensemble20,,,"Exponent of time change and angle influence -2 and -5, Final eq. Area 60 and 30,All simulations are good. The ones with area = 30 are thinner and look better in shape, but elongate less overall. Exponent -2 is better than -5. -2 makes elongation proggressive, but -5 is too static until the end, so in -2 elongation is greater. Next, try lower exponents. However, in sim 2 there are 89000 T1s (exp = -5), versus 57000 in sim 3 (exp = -2)",

small4,,Tried bias in X direction (bias is more intense in the center of the wing). This was subsequently removed from the code,"Bias is difficult to control, but when very small gives acceptable results. Term4 value was 0.01 or 0.002 in the ones with good shape; spatialmintension=-0.2,spatialmaxtension=0.1 or 0.2;max_vertex_movement=0.01;temperature=0.05 ",0 2 4 6
small5,"Like small3, but with vary_edge_tension_with_time","time_exponent=-1 -2;temporal_angle_effect_max=0.2. Besides budsmall, tried strechsmall initial condition, which has more elongated cells in the AP direction. ENERGY_TERM_3 should be 1, not more","Adding time exponent solves an important problem: cells don’t pile up, so the number of rows doesn’t increase that much. The strechsmall condition results in more elongated wings than smallbud (of course). Also, bigger vertex movement leads to less elongated wings. ",
