Ensemble	From	Code changed	Params changed	Results	Good simulations
ensemble27				Best so far	18, 36
ensemble28	ensemble27_18		Blade preferred area initial and final 	No better than 27_18 or 36	
ensemble29	ensemble27_18		Blade preferred area initial and final (smaller than 28); spring tension	No better than 27_18 or 36	
ensemble30	ensemble27_36		Spring tension (lower than 29)		
ensemble31	ensemble27_36		Like 30, but division angle is 20% random		
ensemble32	ensemble27_36		Spring tension (like 20) and lower values of border tension; division longest axis	Not much change	
ensemble33	ensemble27_36		Like 32; division 20% random	slightly more disorganized, more T1s	
ensemble34	ensemble27_36		Like 32; division 90% random	Not much change	
ensemble35	ensemble27_36		Like 32; division 90% random only in blade and hinge; 100% longest axis in veins	Not much change	
ensemble36	ensemble27_36		Negative tension in veins	Crazy, not useful	
ensemble37	ensemble36	No transitions in veins and between veins and intervein tissue	Negative tension in veins	Not much change, but take into accound: some look good although less stable	
ensemble38	ensemble27_36		Veins decreased cell size in blade
